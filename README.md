# Mini-Memgraph
A basic wrapper to simplify interacting with a local [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/) instance using Python.

Produced predominantly to serve as a common backend class for my other projects, but should be suitable for general use. Docstrings incoming and pull requests welcomed.

## Installation
Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mini-memgraph/)

`pip install mini-memgraph`

## Disclaimer
This software was produced as a backend interface for an unsecured locally hosted Memgraph database for data analysis 
and research. I am not qualified to write secure code that would be suitable for a production environment. 
Do not use this code for production. All code is utilised at user's own risk etc.
